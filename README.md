# GWE-Calclator

This program constitutes my first complete project using python, and my first attempt at making a tkinter GUI. The program is a simple calculator to track the cost of gas, water, electric usage.
It allows the user to input the cost per unit and keep a record of thier GWE metres. The output data is based on these inputs.

As my first ever program, it's rough around the edges to say the least. Improvements to be made contain the following.
  1.add exception handling(yes, there's none).
  2.when the user inputs a date period to print output for, provide a list of dates that for which there are actually records.
  3.there are several instances of repetitive code which can fixed.
  4.move functions into seperate files for readablilty (some functions exist as modules, others don't because I got lazy).
